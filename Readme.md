#Data Structures and Algorithms in Computer Science
This project shows the implementation of various algorithms as well as relevant data structures.
It explains : 
- What they are
- When they can be used
- How they can be used

##1. Arrays
An array is a static data structure which holds homogenous data and can have 
variable length.

###Types of Arrays
Arrays come in different types based on the dimension

1. One Dimensional Array - Data is represented in a row
2. Two Dimensional Array - This is known as array of arrays. 
3. MultiDimensional Array - Nested Arrays with >= 3 dimensions
