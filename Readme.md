#Data Structures and Algorithms in Computer Science
This project shows the implementation of various algorithms as well 
as relevant data structures.
It explains : 
- What they are
- When they can be used
- How they can be used

##1. Arrays
An array is a static data structure which holds homogenous data and can 
have variable length.

###Types of Arrays
Arrays come in different types based on the dimension

1. One Dimensional Array - Data is represented in a row
2. Two Dimensional Array - This is known as array of arrays. 
3. MultiDimensional Array - Nested Arrays with >= 3 dimensions

###Operations on Arrays
Item 3 and 4 are algorithms performed on arrays
Each operation has its own specific Time and Space Complexity

1. Write (Insert, Update)
2. Read
3. Sort 
    * Bubble Sort : Simplest Sort Algorithm. It involves continuous swapping of 
    elements if the order is misplaced while going through each element 
    in the array.
    * Selection Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
4. Search
